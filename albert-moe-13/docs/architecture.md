## Overview

Albert MoE-13 is a ternary-native transformer with Mixture-of-Experts feed-forward layers. Every weight matrix is quantized to {-1, 0, +1} during both forward and backward passes via Straight-Through Estimation. The architecture grows its own depth autonomously through the `EvolutionManager`. Five autonomous surgeries carried it from 12L to 17L during the v3.0 run.

**Current state (2026-05-15):** 256H · 17L · 4H · 12E · 256CTX · 32kV · Global Epoch 1191+ · epoch-ATL 10.1993 (ep1189) · batch-ATL 10.1600 (ep1185)

## 1. Ternary Quantization (STE)

Each `TernaryLinear` layer holds float32 weights in the optimizer but applies ternary quantization on every forward pass:

```
w_ternary = sign(w) * I(|w| > τ)   [τ = per-layer threshold]
y = w_ternary * γ                   [γ = mean(|w|), cached every 20 steps]
```

The Straight-Through Estimator passes the gradient through the quantization step unchanged:

```
∂L/∂w ≈ ∂L/∂y   (gradient bypasses the non-differentiable threshold)
```

**Per-layer thresholds** — early layers stay dense, late layers grow sparse:

| Layer | Threshold τ | Effect |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 0 | 0.01 | Dense — learns syntax and token co-occurrence |
| 1 | 0.02 | Medium — learns phrase-level patterns |
| 2+ | 0.03+ | Sparse — abstract representations, most weights zeroed |

**TELE sparsity telemetry (confirmed at 12L, structurally consistent through 17L):** L0 at 10.6% ternary weight sparsity, rising monotonically toward the deepest layers at ~26%+. Deeper layers accumulate more zero-weight trits, reinforcing `@sparseskip` efficiency at the layers where it matters most.

**Gamma cache** — `mean(|w|)` is expensive on large weight matrices. It is recomputed only every 20 forward calls; weights change slowly enough that the cached value is mathematically equivalent.

**L1 sparsity regularization** — the training loss includes a small L1 penalty on all weight matrices (`λ = 1e-5`). This gives the optimizer a gradient signal to push marginal weights toward zero, so ternary zeroing is strategic rather than random.

## 2. Transformer Block

Each block follows a standard pre-norm transformer layout:

```
x → LayerNorm → MultiHeadAttention → residual
  → LayerNorm → MoEBlock → residual
```

### Multi-Head Attention

- 4 heads, head dimension = hidden_size / 4
- Q, K, V, O projections are all `TernaryLinear`
- Causal mask is cached in a `RefCell<Option<(usize, Tensor)>>` — rebuilt only when `seq_len` changes, eliminating a 128×128 allocation per attention call per layer

### MoE Block

12 experts, each a two-layer MLP (`hidden_size → hidden_size × 4 → hidden_size`), all ternary.

**Routing:**
1. Gate network (`TernaryLinear`: `hidden_size → 12`) produces logits
2. Uniform noise (0.98–1.02×) is added for exploration
3. Top-3 experts are selected via sequential argmax-and-mask
4. **Asymmetric safety gating** — Experts 0–3 are suppressed to zero when their gate value is below 0.05 (low-confidence guard)
5. Selected expert outputs are weighted by softmax over the top-3 gate values and summed
6. **`@sparseskip`** (Patent A50296/2026) — 9/12 experts not executed per decode step at Top-3 routing; 4.58× throughput multiplier at 75% sparsity

---

## 3. Ternary Traffic Light Routing (TTL)

TTL assigns each expert in each layer a trit state: **Green** (actively routing), **Orange** (warming up), or **Red** (stagnant). States are maintained as EMA-smoothed activation counts:

```
ema_i = α * ema_i + (1 − α) * routed_i    [α = 0.95, per-step update]
```

States transition based on thresholds:
- `G` — ema > high_threshold: expert is active and routing normally
- `O` — ema in [low_threshold, high_threshold]: expert is in transition
- `R` — ema < low_threshold: expert is receiving insufficient routing signal

**Anti-stagnation burst:** When all experts in a layer remain Orange for ≥100 consecutive steps, TTL forces a routing pattern of 3G + 3R for 30 steps, rotating via `burst_count × 7 mod 12`. The offset 7 is coprime to 12, ensuring every expert is visited across burst cycles before the pattern repeats.

**Cycling reds (observed at 12L, stable through 17L):** R-state experts migrate autonomously through cold layers and self-resolve without intervention. Multiple episodes observed across the full run; all resolved with dead=0.

**TLIGHT log format:** `TLIGHT ep=N layer=L [G:a,b,c O:d,e,f R:g,h,i]`

---

## 4. Mycelium Expert Health Monitor

Mycelium maintains a 20-epoch rolling gradient pressure window per expert per layer, producing a pressure history `P[l,i]`:

```
P[l,i] = mean(grad_norm[l,i] over last 20 epochs)
```

Experts whose pressure falls below threshold for ≥8 consecutive epochs are classified dead. `generate_resurrections()` copies the most-active neighbour's weights into the dead expert with a small Gaussian perturbation (σ = 0.02), restoring gradient signal without disrupting surrounding routing structure.

**MYCELIUM log format:** `MYCELIUM epoch=N dead=D blooming=B hot=LH cold=LC pressure=[p0,...,p11]`

**Layer crystallization (confirmed at 12L, extended through 17L):** Pressure gradient follows a consistent staircase pattern. At 17L:
- L0–L3: nearly frozen (early layers have locked in stable feature representations)
- L4–L9: moderate activity, gradual gradient increase
- L10–L16: hot — deepest layers continue active learning (hot layer at L10 as of ep1185, structural)

This internal differentiation — both in gradient flow and weight sparsity — emerged from training alone without architectural intervention.

**Result over full run:** `dead=0` maintained throughout. All 12 experts remain alive and routing across all 17 layers.

## 5. Auto-Evolutionary Training (EvolutionManager)

The `EvolutionManager` monitors epoch-average loss and triggers **Net2Net safe-copy surgery** when the model plateaus:

```
plateau_threshold  = 0.02 nats span over plateau window (Fibonacci-gated)
plateau_window     = Fibonacci sequence: F3=2, F4=3, ..., F9=144 (current: 144 epochs)
fib_index          = 8 (F9 window), advances after each surgery
mastery_threshold  = 8.4   (guards against surgery during vocab-transfer plateau)
max_layers         = uncapped in v3.0 (governed by plateau gate + cord-surgery threshold)
```

**Surgery procedure:**
1. `config.json` `num_layers` is incremented
2. The new layer's weights are initialized as a safe copy of the deepest existing layer (Net2Net — preserves learned representations)
3. Training resumes with the expanded architecture

**Corpus unlocking:** The EvolutionManager queries the current layer count at each surgery event and enables newly unlocked corpus stages automatically. Stage 6 (Gutenberg) unlocks at 6L; Stage 7 (Simple Wikipedia) at 7L. This couples architectural depth to corpus breadth.

Albert grew from 3L to 12L across ten autonomous surgery events (v2.0.0 run), then 12L to 17L across five more surgeries in the v3.0 run (ep511, ep547, ep611, ep645, ep701). Growth continues — 17L→18L surgery pending the F9 plateau gate (144-epoch window).

## 6. Training Loop

```
for each global epoch (300 batches):
    for each batch:
        sample random 128-token window from corpus
        forward pass through transformer
        ce_loss = cross_entropy(logits, targets)
        lb_loss = load_balancing_aux_loss(routing_weights)  [λ = 0.03]
        l1_penalty = λ * mean(|weights|) for all weight matrices  [λ = 1e-5]
        total_loss = ce_loss + lb_loss + l1_penalty
        opt.backward_step(total_loss)
        log to dashboard/training.log
    write epoch summary to log
    save checkpoint
    check EvolutionManager → surgery if triggered
    update TTL states per layer
    update Mycelium pressure window
```

**Learning rate** — cosine schedule, reset per surgery phase:
```
lr(t) = lr_min + 0.5 * (lr_max - lr_min) * (1 + cos(π * t / T))
lr_max = 3e-4,  lr_min = 1e-5,  T = 500 global epochs per phase
```
Training runs continuously past the cosine floor at Modal T4 GPU speeds (~450 ms/batch). The LR holds at the floor value (1e-5) in the post-500 phase; the schedule is not re-initialized between surgeries.

## 7. Corpus Pipeline

Stage-aware curriculum: `load_corpus()` reads `.txt` files from the active stage directories. The EvolutionManager enables stages as layer count grows.

| Stage | Unlock | Corpus | Size |
|-------|--------|--------|------|
| 3 | 3L | King James Bible + Alice in Wonderland | ~4.6 MB |
| 6 | 6L | 12 Gutenberg classics (Dickens, Austen, Tolstoy, et al.) | ~12.0 MB |
| 7 | 7L | Simple English Wikipedia | ~9.9 MB |
| 9 | 9L | QA instruction pairs (User:/Albert: format) | ~0.5 MB |
| 10 | 16L | dev_blogs, github_bugs, hn_discussions, gourmet_recipes, repair_guides, trails_travel | ~varied |
| 11 | 11L | Linux documentation, EU AI Act | ~0.4 MB |

All stages (3–10) active at 17L. Training samples random 256-token windows from the concatenated token stream.

### v3.0 Corpus Structure

The v3.0 corpus (all stages active at 17L):

| Directory | Content | Actual size |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `data/multilingual/` | Wikipedia CC BY-SA + Europarl (EN/DE/FR/ES/PT/IT/NL/PL) | ~446 MB |
| `data/academic/` | Academic texts | ~46 MB |
| `data/fulltext/` | Gutenberg multilingual novels | ~68 MB |
| `data/chaos/` | 10% chaos layer — OCR-corrupted, unanswered, mixed-language noise | ~43 MB |

**Total v3.0 corpus: ~635 MB raw.**

### The 90/10 Invariant — Standing Team Rule

**The chaos layer must always represent ~10% of total tokenizer corpus volume. This ratio is non-negotiable and must be maintained as the corpus grows.**

Rationale: A model trained exclusively on clean, resolved text acquires a dangerous prior — it assumes the world closes. The 10% chaos layer shifts that prior, ensuring albert. learns at the statistical baseline that some inputs have no clean resolution. This is the *uncertainty tithe*: expressed in the corpus, in the routing entropy floor (ENTR ≥ 2.480), in the TTL orange-default, and in @sparseskip withholding 75% of expert capacity per step.

**Enforcement:**
- When adding new clean corpus data, add proportional chaos data to maintain the ratio
- `train_tokenizer_v3.py` prints the chaos % at training time and warns if outside 8–12%
- `build_chaos_corpus.py --target-mb N` generates N MB of chaos; scale N with corpus growth
- Do not merge a corpus expansion PR without updating the chaos layer to match

## 8. Dashboard Telemetry

`dashboard/index.html` polls `dashboard/training.log` via HTTP byte-range requests every 500ms (POLL_MS=500, tuned for Modal T4 ~450 ms/batch cadence). Each new batch produces one dot on the scatter plot. The dashboard tracks:

- **Loss scatter** with drop animation for new dots
- **SMA-30 trend line**
- **EP AVG reference line** (MT5-style dashed orange) — updates once per completed epoch
- **ARCH display** — live from `ARCH NL NH NE NCTX NV` log lines
- **Epoch filter** (ALL / 200 / 100 / 50 / 20 / 10 / 5 EP) doubles as live auto-follow — viewport advances with training frontier when a filter is active
- **TLIGHT heatmap** — expert routing state per layer, color-coded G/O/R
- **MYCELIUM panel** — dead/blooming/hot/cold counts, pressure array per epoch
