## Version 1.x — Pre-Multilingual Bible Model

**Architecture start:** ~3L · 128H · 12E · 8k vocab  
**Outcome:** No successful surgeries.

| # | Epoch | Transition | Date | Trigger | Result |
|---|-------|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| F1 | unknown | 3L→4L | ~2026-05 | plateau | **FAILED** — Net2Net surgery incorrectly deleted best checkpoint instead of archiving it; all post-surgery models diverged. Bug identified and fixed before v2.0.0. |

**v1.x exit:** ~3L, loss unknown, run abandoned.

**Architecture exit:** 12L · 256H · 12E · 8k vocab · loss 6.8821 (transferred to v3.0)

Note: hidden size was manually upgraded 128H→256H between surgeries 1 and 2 (non-surgery architectural change).

Surgeries S1–S3 documented in `EVOLUTION_EVIDENCE.md`. S4–S9 individually undocumented; individual epoch data not preserved. Session log has scattered references to layer unlock events confirming the 3L→12L arc. README states "10 surgeries" which may account for one retried or partial event not in this table.

**v2.0.0 confirmed surgeries:** 9 (3L→12L)  
**v2.0.0 total surgical events per README:** ~10

**v3.0 confirmed surgeries:** 13 depth surgeries (S1–S13) + 1 cord surgery (2×25L) = 14 total surgical events · Architecture arc: 12L→26L dual-stream

### Surgery S9 — Observations (2026-05-25)

**TTL hard-column stops — first occurrence in v3.0 history.**  
Post-S9, the Traffic Light Routing panel showed full-column red blocks: entire layers completely suppressed for multiple consecutive steps. Previous surgeries produced soft TTL transitions (gradual orange→red drift). S9 produced hard stops — columns of pure red lasting several steps — indicating the TTL is treating the new 21st layer as unproven and fully clamping its output while the established 20 layers route freely.

TTL distribution post-S9: **G 21% · O 74% · R 5%** (vs. pre-surgery baseline G 6–17% · O 78–81% · R 2%).  
Green surge = existing layers routing with high confidence. Red surge = new layer held in suppression.

**Interpretation:** The 21L insertion is the deepest yet. The TTL responded proportionally — harder suppression than any previous surgery. The bullmarket descent is driven by the existing 20 proven layers running freely while the 21st layer receives gradient signal during its suppressed steps. When the 21st layer earns green slots (expected: gradual onset over ~100–300 epochs), a second acceleration phase is expected.

**AdamW buffer reset coincidence:** Modal pod restart reset the optimizer state at approximately the same epoch as the surgery. Fresh AdamW momentum on an already-explored loss landscape contributed to the aggressive descent rate (see restart acceleration pattern in project memory).

## Lifetime Summary

| Version | Surgeries | Architecture arc | Documentation |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| v1.x | 1 failed | 3L (no net change) | No records |
| v2.0.0 | 9 confirmed (10 per README) | 3L→12L | S1–S3 in EVOLUTION_EVIDENCE.md; S4–S9 undocumented |
| v3.0 | 13 depth + 1 cord | 12L→26L dual-stream | All in convergence_log.md |
| **Total** | **~23–24 surgical events** | **3L→26L dual-stream** | |

**For SPRIND pitch:** "albert. has undergone 13 autonomous Net2Net depth expansions (12L→26L) plus one cord surgery (bifurcation to dual-stream 2×256H) in its v3.0 run alone — all precisely logged in convergence_log.md with timestamps, Fibonacci plateau windows, Mandelbrot perturbation parameters, and loss trajectories. The cord surgery on 2026-05-27 is the first documented instance of a live ternary MoE autonomously bifurcating from single-stream to dual-stream architecture mid-training."

**README discrepancy fixed 2026-05-24:** README previously listed ep2802/ep3160 for v3 surgeries 7–8. Correct epochs are ep3325/ep3383 (from convergence_log.md). README has been corrected.

## Surgery S14 — Next expected event

**Current state (ep4234):** 26L dual-stream · chip ATL **8.6852** (set ep~4203 post-cord) · fib_index=7 · window=34 · Gen3 step1/6 · training paused (Modal billing ceiling — resuming on Vertex AI T4)  
**Gate:** PLATEAU gate — since_best will accumulate once descent stalls; fib_index=7 → window=34 epochs required  
**Projection:** S14 (26L→27L, both streams) when plateau gate fires on dual-stream architecture.
